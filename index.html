            <p>
                Hello everyone, I'm from Serbia and <span id="years"></span> years old at the moment.<br>
                I went to Mechanical engineering university and quit it at second year.<br> 
                One day I was searching some material on my laptop and python course poped up. <br>
                When I saw course I gave it a try and fell in love with it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea about becoming developer came. I tap into different branches of programming and experimented for a while. <br>
                I just love it was hobby while working with my dad. I felt like I want to work something that don't seem like work to me. <br>
                At that point decided to go deep in web development. <br>
                Now nearly job and really excited about what will be the next step in my life.
